# upload_module
In this Assessment I used technologies i.e HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, JavaScript and Javascript Framework (Jquery). I had created Responsive User Login Page and Upload Page Module.

I had attached the CSV file i.e data.csv for upload and check the site.

Working of Site are as follows:

1. Member Login Page - Enter Email Id and Password and click on Submit to enter into the site for upload the data.

2. Upload Page - Upload CSV file to retreive the data you can upload the file i.e data.csv which is been attached in source code. 

After uploading you will get the data there will be action column you can edit and delete your data.
